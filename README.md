## About
In this assignment, I had the choice of creating a 3D game, tool, or tech demo to demonstrate my understanding of 3D graphics and programming principles. I decided to create a 3D Model Viewer, which could handle custom models and their textures using the text file provided. 

### Lighting 
Three types of lighting were implemented (in order of appearance): diffuse, ambient and specular.

### UI Elements

#### Texture

In the top-left of the UI, the texture of the model will display.

#### Scaling

In case the custom models loaded were large, I implemented scaling buttons to increase and decrease the model.
